If your enrollment request is denied, you’ll have the chance to appeal. Although Americans who age into Medicare have the option to place off enrolling in Part B, individuals who do make that alternative need to proceed with caution to avoid enrollment penalties that might continue indefinitely.<p>
<p>As a common rule, individuals who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five must confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not.
