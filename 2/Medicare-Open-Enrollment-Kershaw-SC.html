<p>I would suggest addressing that concern with a union consultant and going from there. Some people choose to pay for health coverage via an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a selection then that’s one thing to first address with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>
<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to maintain it once you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment period that lasts eight months.

These plans combine excessive-deductible insurance plan options with a medical savings account that you use specifically to cover healthcare costs.<p>
<p>Most enrollees are in plans that provide entry to some dental care (67%), a health benefit (seventy two%), and/or eye exams or glasses (78%). The share of Medicare beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans , varies throughout the country.<p>
