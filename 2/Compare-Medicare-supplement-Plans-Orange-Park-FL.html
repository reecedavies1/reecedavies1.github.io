Once the OOP most is reached for an individual beneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays 100% of medical services for the rest of the calendar yr. That protection has no lifetime maximum, another downside with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime limit on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP restrict doesn't apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage .<p>
<p>But these averages mask broad regional and helpful differences. Just as the most important advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the major determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the scale of that protection.
