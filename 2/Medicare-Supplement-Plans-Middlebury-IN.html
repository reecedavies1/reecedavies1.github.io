<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>If you do not have Medicare otherwise you need to sign up for Part A , contactSocial Security. Your plan leaves the Medicare program in the middle of the yr. There are deadlines for enrolling in several elements of Medicare. We explain these deadlines and the penalties you may accrue should you miss them.<p>
