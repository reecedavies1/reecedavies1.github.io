Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual beneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays one hundred% of medical providers for the remainder of the calendar 12 months. That safety has no lifetime maximum, one other drawback with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime restrict on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP limit does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage .<p>
