<p>As a common rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five have to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage by way of them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union legal guidelines mandating that you just sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>

If you are required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you are not required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you simply send in a denial letter from Social Security to keep your present coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your present retiree plan has a Medicare version or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan when you turn 65, once Medicare has approved your enrollment form.<p>
