If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
