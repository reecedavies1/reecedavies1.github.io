<p>When you start Part B, it triggers a particular election period that lets you make changes to your coverage outdoors of the usual enrollment periods. If you don’t enroll in Medicare Part B throughout your preliminary enrollment interval, you could have another probability every year to enroll during a “general enrollment period” from January 1 via March 31. You can sign up for Medicare Part B at any time that you've coverage via present or active employment. Or you'll be able to sign up for Medicare through the eight-month Special Enrollment Period that begins when your employer or union group coverage ends or you cease working .

<p>If you aren't signing up for Medicare at sixty five and at present have company offered group coverage, are you required to confirm this with Medicare?
