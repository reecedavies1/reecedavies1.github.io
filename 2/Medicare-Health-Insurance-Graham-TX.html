When very small employers join together with other employers in situations like this, the plan will provide major coverage as long as no less than one of many employers has 20+ workers. But employers can also ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll should check together with his group plan to see what their specific rules are.
