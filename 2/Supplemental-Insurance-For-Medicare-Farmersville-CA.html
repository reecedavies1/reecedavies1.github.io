<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<p>Replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare prescription drug plan. Switch to a different Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. Enroll in a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. If you qualify, you can return to Original Medicare (Parts A & B) or join, change or drop a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Prescription Drug plan. Some of those "qualifying occasions" might embrace retiring and no longer having coverage from an employer or transferring out of your present plan’s service area.<p>
<p>But it appears such as you’ll be enrolling at Medicare at sixty five, in which case you don’t get retro benefits since you weren’t entitled to them previous to sixty five. Hi Karen, when you enroll in Medicare Part A, you will be penalized for continuing to contribute to an HSA. Your Part A will take impact back to the date you qualified for Medicare .<p>
