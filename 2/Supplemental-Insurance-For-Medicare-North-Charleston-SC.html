<p>However, home companions (same-gender and reverse-gender) are usually not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are advised to contact Social Security three months earlier than turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The rules are totally different for employees and retirees; so to be sure you enroll correctly, avoid Medicare premium penalties and understand how Medicare works along with your UC-sponsored medical plan, comply with these steps.
