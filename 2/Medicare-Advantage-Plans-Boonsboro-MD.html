<p>Advantage plans supply additional coverage like hearing services, prescription drug coverage, dental companies, and imaginative and prescient care. Medicare Advantage plans would possibly save you cash, however remember to check whether or not prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll want to buy a separate Part D plan if you would like that coverage. Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and different out-of-pocket expenses, and whether or not there are any limits of their coverage. If extra benefits are included, corresponding to help with hearing aids and dental payments, make sure to find out how much of those bills will actually be coated.<p>
<p>Generally you possibly can enroll in Medicare only through the Medicare common enrollment period . Generally, if an individual continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and may enroll later during a SEP. For instance, employer coverage for retirees or via COBRA doesn’t count as present employment, so these people don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>

Only give your Medicare Number to docs, pharmacists, other health care suppliers, your insurers, or people you belief to work with Medicare in your behalf. If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan , your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your major card for Medicare—you should nonetheless keep and use it whenever you want care. And, if you have a Medicare drug plan, remember to hold that card as properly.<p>
