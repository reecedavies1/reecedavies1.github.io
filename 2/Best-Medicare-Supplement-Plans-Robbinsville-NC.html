<p>You can apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan any time through the year. The Special Enrollment Period allows you to change or add Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug coverage exterior of AEP as a result of certain qualifying events.

<p>Medicare Advantage is a type of medical insurance plan within the United States that provides Medicare benefits through a private-sector health insurer. In a Medicare Advantage plan, a Medicare beneficiary pays a monthly premium to a private insurance company and receives coverage for inpatient hospital ("Part A") and outpatient ("Part B") services.<p>
<h3>How to Avail the Best Health Insurance Plans in Robbinsville</h3>

Instead of simply responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all of the Medicare options in your space. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare tool at Medicare.gov/mppf, looking at both premiums and whole estimated costs for folks like yourself. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan may need a $15 copay when you see the physician.<p>

In turn, the Medicare program pays Medicare Advantage insurers a monthly charge per enrollee to cover the price of carrying their beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage enrollees are responsible for paying the Part B premium, in addition to any premium charged by the plan.<p>
