You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
