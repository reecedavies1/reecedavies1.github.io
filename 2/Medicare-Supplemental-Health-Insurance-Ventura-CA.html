<p>Where our website links to specific products or displays 'Go to site' buttons, we could receive a commission, referral payment or cost whenever you click on on those buttons or apply for a product. I am now 60 and my circumstances have changed where I might need to work on an informal basis. For example if I work forty hours/week for three months, after which nothing for the rest of the yr, is my work averaged out over the yr, which might bring me under the 10 hours/week? Or would this break the 10 hours/week rule, and what are the results? But if in case you still have an energetic super with you, you might give that to your employer so they may proceed paying that for you.<p>
<p>Keep in thoughts that your new coverage begins on the primary day of the month after you submit your enrollment application, meaning if you apply on February eight, your new Medicare plan wouldn’t start till March 1.

<p>But should you enrolled in Medicare regardless of having health coverage, it leads me to consider that your employer coverage left some gaps, which is why you selected Medicare. Either means, you could have the option to stop Medicare and join again when you need it. My husband is eligible for medicare in March but is still working full time and can continue to do so until he's 70.
