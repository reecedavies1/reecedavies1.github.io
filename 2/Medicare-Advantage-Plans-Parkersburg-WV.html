<p>But these averages mask broad regional and useful variations. Just as an important benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the main determinant of month-to-month premium variations is the scale of that safety. By regulation, a Part C beneficiary can not spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical services; it's plans with this restrict which have the bottom premiums.
