<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent payments, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Call or visit the website of your State Health Insurance Assistance Program . Your native SHIP may help you perceive your Medicare coverage options and navigate any changes. If you have Original Medicare, take a look at next year’s Medicare & You handbook to know your Medicare costs and benefits for the upcoming 12 months.<p>
<p>Replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare prescription drug plan. Switch to a unique Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. Enroll in a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. If you qualify, you can return to Original Medicare (Parts A & B) or be part of, change or drop a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Prescription Drug plan. Some of these "qualifying events" could include retiring and not having coverage from an employer or transferring out of your current plan’s service space.<p>
