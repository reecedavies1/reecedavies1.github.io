That is, under Part C plans, there is a limit on how much a beneficiary will have to spend annually OOP. Medicare pays a fixed quantity on your care each month to the companies offering Medicare Advantage Plans. In most states, nearly all of enrollees are in HMOs; nonetheless, in 12 states , the majority of enrollees are in native PPOs .<p>
<p>Some could pay a portion of out-of-community care, while others will cover solely doctors and facilities which are in the HMO or PPO community.
