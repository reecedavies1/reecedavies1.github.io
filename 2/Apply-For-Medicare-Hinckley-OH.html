You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
