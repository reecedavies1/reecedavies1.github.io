<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age sixty five need to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage via them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union laws mandating that you just sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
