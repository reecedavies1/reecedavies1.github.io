<p>The size of Medicare Advantage provider networks for physicians and hospitals vary significantly both across counties and across plans in the identical county. NoteEach year, plans set the amounts they cost for premiums, deductibles, and services. The plan decides how much you pay for the lined services you get.<p>
<p>Medicare Advantage plans may cost lower premiums than you’d pay for Medicare plus a medigap policy and Part D prescription-drug coverage. But you could end up paying larger out-of-pocket prices all year long. Private Medicare Advantage plans can be a good deal for seniors looking for all-in-one medical and drug coverage.
