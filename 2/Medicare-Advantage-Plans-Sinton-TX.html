Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and a few have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your current retiree plan has a Medicare model or associate plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan when you flip 65, as soon as Medicare has permitted your enrollment form.<p>
