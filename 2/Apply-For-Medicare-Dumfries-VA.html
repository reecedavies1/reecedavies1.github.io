<h3>Know More About Types of Health Insurance Plans in Dumfries</h3>
<p>Remember that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B during your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to wait till the next General Enrollment Period, which happens from January 1 to March 31 each year. You might then have to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you could have had Part B and did not enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a ten% larger premium for every 12-month interval that you just have been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t sign up for it. You could should pay this higher premium for so long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
<p>You can contact the Social Security Administration at for more info, however in a nutshell, you’ll ask for a few specific forms that you’ll fill out or have your employer fill out. That’s the way you’ll provide proof that you just’re entitled to a special enrollment period.<p>
