<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
