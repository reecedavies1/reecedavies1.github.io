Krugman cites all the familiar figures from the rest of the developed world, the place some mix of public insurance with some private elements manages to cover nearly everybody and at a much lower cost than in the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the desk on this nation by the private corporate pursuits who revenue from the expensive mess of a health care system we now have now.
