<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
