<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
