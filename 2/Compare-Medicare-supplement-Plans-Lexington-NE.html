You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.

MSA plans don’t cover prescription drugs, but you can enroll in a standalone Part D plan individually.
