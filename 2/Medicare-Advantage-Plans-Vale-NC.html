Krugman cites all the familiar figures from the rest of the developed world, where some mixture of public insurance with some private parts manages to cover almost everybody and at a much lower cost than within the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the table in this country by the private corporate pursuits who profit from the expensive mess of a health care system we have now.
