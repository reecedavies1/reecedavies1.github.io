<p>If you enroll in Medicare during the January – March General Enrollment period, you can enroll in Part D between April 1 and June 30. But Medicare Part B has a monthly premium — projected to be about $153.30/month in 2021 — which might be deducted from your Social Security or Railroad Retirement check. You’re eligible to enroll in Medicare Part D as long as you have either Medicare Part A or Part B.<p>
