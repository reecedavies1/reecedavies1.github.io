You might then have to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you could have had Part B and did not enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% higher premium for each 12-month interval that you just had been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t join it.

<p>Medicare is a national medical insurance program that covers hundreds of thousands of people and includes a good greater number of healthcare providers and services. If you could have missed the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment period, there is a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 every year.
