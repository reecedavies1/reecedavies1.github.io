Or would this break the ten hours/week rule, and what are the implications?

<p>Advantage plans provide additional coverage like hearing providers, prescription drug coverage, dental providers, and imaginative and prescient care. Medicare Advantage plans would possibly save you money, but make sure to check whether or not prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll want to purchase a separate Part D plan if you want that coverage. Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and different out-of-pocket expenses, and whether or not there are any limits in their coverage. If extra benefits are included, similar to assist with listening to aids and dental payments, make sure to learn the way much of these expenses will truly be coated.<p>

Hi Marcia, Both you and your husband should think about enrolling for Medicare Part B proper when he retires.
