<p>The exception to this is if you have end-stage renal illness . If you've ESRD and had a kidney transplant or need regular kidney dialysis, you can apply for Medicare. If you have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also called ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease), you'll automatically be enrolled in Original Medicare in the identical month that your disability benefits begin.<p>
<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans don't cover benefits like imaginative and prescient, dental, eyeglasses, listening to aids, or prescription drug coverage.

<p>When you file in your own retirement benefit, you'll receive an extra fee roughly equal to the amount by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit. Social Security may name this complete quantity your retirement benefit, however we expect that’s misleading.
