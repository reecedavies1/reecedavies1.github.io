<p>However, domestic partners (same-gender and opposite-gender) are normally not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are advised to contact Social Security three months before turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred.
