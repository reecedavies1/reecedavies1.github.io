Prior authorization is most often required for comparatively costly companies, similar to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B drugs, however sometimes required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to make use of “step remedy” for Part B medication, meaning that they are required to attempt some particular drugs earlier than they obtain approval to attempt other medication. In contrast to Medicare Advantage plans, conventional Medicare does not generally require prior authorization for services, and doesn't require step remedy for Part B medicine.<p>
