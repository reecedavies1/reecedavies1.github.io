The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period runs from January 1 to March 31. Many beneficiaries are routinely eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A coverage; for example, those that have labored or spouses have worked no less than 10 years, or forty quarters, and paid Medicare taxes via their employment. You’ll in all probability wish to enroll in Medicare when you first become eligible — for instance, whenever you’re approaching your sixty fifth birthday.<p>

<p>These people will get a packet of data a few months before they flip 65 or obtain their twenty fifth month of Social Security Disability or Railroad Retirement Board benefits.

Only give your Medicare Number to medical doctors, pharmacists, different health care providers, your insurers, or individuals you belief to work with Medicare in your behalf.
