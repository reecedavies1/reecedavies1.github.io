<p>These applications are also designed to fill in gaps that Medicare does not cover. They don't substitute for Medicare, and the rules say you still have to enroll in that program whenever you turn 65. If you lost your job and signed up for COBRA to extend your employer's health coverage, this does not shield you towards late penalties for not signing up for Medicare.
