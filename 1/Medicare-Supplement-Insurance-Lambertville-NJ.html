You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

If you aren’t getting benefits from Social Security no less than four months before you turn sixty five, you may want to enroll with Social Security to get Part A and Part B. I’ll be getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board at least four months before I flip 65. In most instances, it is determined by whether you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>
