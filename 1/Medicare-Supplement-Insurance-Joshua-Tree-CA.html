<p>Some might pay a portion of out-of-community care, while others will cover solely docs and amenities that are within the HMO or PPO community. An MA plan should provide enrollees in that plan with coverage of all providers that are coated by Medicare Parts A and B, plus additional benefits past those covered by Medicare.

<p>Medicare Advantage is a kind of health insurance plan within the United States that gives Medicare benefits through a personal-sector health insurer.

<p>The common enrollment interval for Original Medicare is from January 1 via March 31 of each 12 months.
