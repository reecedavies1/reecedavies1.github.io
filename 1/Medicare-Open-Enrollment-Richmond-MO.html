If you've a period of sixty three or extra days in a row without creditable coverage, you would pay a late-enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>As a common rule, individuals who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five need to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form generally known as L564.

<p>To request a discount in that revenue-associated amount due to a life-altering event like retiring, the Social Security Administration has a form you'll be able to fill out. Some recipients won't pay the total $144.60 commonplace premium because of a "hold harmless" provision that stops their Part B premiums from rising greater than their Social Security cost-of-dwelling adjustment, or COLA. The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B will be $144.60 for 2020, up $9.10 from $135.50 in 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced Friday.<p>
