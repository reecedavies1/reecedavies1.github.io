People who are eligible for Medicare based mostly on disability could also be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period based mostly on their or their partner’s current employment. They may be eligible primarily based on a partner or family member’s current employment if the employer has one hundred or more workers.<p>
<p>Keep in thoughts that your new coverage begins on the first day of the month after you submit your enrollment application, which means if you apply on February 8, your new Medicare plan wouldn’t start until March 1.
