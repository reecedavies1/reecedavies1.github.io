<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<p>But when you enrolled in Medicare despite having health coverage, it leads me to consider that your employer coverage left some gaps, which is why you selected Medicare. Either method, you could have the choice to cease Medicare and join again if you want it. My husband is eligible for medicare in March however remains to be working full time and can continue to do so until he's 70. I and our son are covered underneath his company insurance which incorporates an HSA.<p>
