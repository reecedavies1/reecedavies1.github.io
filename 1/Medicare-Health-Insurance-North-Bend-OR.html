You don’t have to join Medicare this year should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
