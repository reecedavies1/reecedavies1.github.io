<p>And you possibly can solely enroll in Part D should you’re additionally enrolled in Part A and/or Part B. Oh and I forgot to say that my work place insurance does have HSA.<p>
<p>As a common rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age 65 have to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564.

People who are eligible for Medicare based mostly on disability may be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period based on their or their spouse’s current employment. They may be eligible based mostly on a spouse or member of the family’s present employment if the employer has one hundred or extra employees.<p>
