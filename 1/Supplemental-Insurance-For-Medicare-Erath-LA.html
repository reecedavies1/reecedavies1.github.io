If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
