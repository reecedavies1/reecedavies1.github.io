This comes with an employer request for info form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage via them because the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union laws mandating that you just join Medicare at a given time.<p>
