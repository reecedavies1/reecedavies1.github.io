<p>Recently, I began an element-time job and saw that the company in withdrawal cash for Medicare. When very small employers be a part of together with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide main coverage as long as a minimum of one of the employers has 20+ staff. But employers can even ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll should check along with his group plan to see what their particular rules are.

<p>I would counsel addressing that issue with a union consultant and going from there. Some people choose to pay for health coverage via an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a selection then that’s something to first handle with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>
<p>A late enrollment penalty could also be relevant if you didn't join Medicare Part B whenever you had been first eligible.
