<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums every month — a premium on your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage.

<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman.
