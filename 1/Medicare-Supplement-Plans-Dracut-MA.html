<p>Most Medicare Advantage plans function ashealth maintenance group orpreferred provider group insurance. HMOs restrict members to utilizing the doctors and hospitals in their networks. PPOs usually let members get care outside the plan's network, however members might should pay more for such care. Some plans require prior authorization for specialist care or procedures, and/or a referral from a main care doctor.<p>
<p>These revenue limits apply in 2020, and are indexed for inflation. There is now not a donut hole in terms of the utmost amount that enrollees can be charged once they fill prescriptions. But the donut gap still exists by way of how insurers design their coverage , how total drug costs are counted, and who covers the majority of the cost of the medication (the drug plan versus the producer; see Figure 4 right here).<p>
