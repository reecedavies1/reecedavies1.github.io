<p>But these averages mask broad regional and helpful differences. Just as crucial benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the major determinant of month-to-month premium variations is the size of that protection. By law, a Part C beneficiary cannot spend more than $6700 out of pocket yearly on medical companies; it's plans with this restrict which have the lowest premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 yearly but in fact -- for these plans -- the premium is higher. Note that an OOP limit isn't a deductible as is usually reported.<p>
