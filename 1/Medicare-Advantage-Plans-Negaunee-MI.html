You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
