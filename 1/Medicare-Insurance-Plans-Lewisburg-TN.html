<p>But 15 p.c of all Medicare beneficiaries are under 65, and have become eligible after receiving Social Security disability benefits for two years or being recognized with ALS or finish-stage renal disease. During the first year a person is enrolled in Medicare Advantage, they will change to Original Medicare and a Part D plan. And with some exceptions, they also have assured-problem access to a Medigap plan.

<p>During 2018, about 16% of people within the study enrolled in Medicare coverage options on-line.

<p>Medicare open enrollment – also called Medicare’s annual election period – runs from October 15 through December 7 every year. To keep your UC-sponsored coverage, you’ll must pay your Medicare Part B premiums without interruption and on time to take care of your Medicare enrollment.

<p>Most Advantage plans charge month-to-month premiums in addition to the Part B premium. (You should pay the Part B premium in addition to your Advantage premium, even when you’re in a “zero premium” Advantage plan).
