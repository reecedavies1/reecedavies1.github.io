<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
