<p>Third, individuals who reside in two totally different geographical areas of the country at totally different times of the year (principally so-referred to as snowbirds) find it troublesome to live with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C threat adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to restrict this churn between kinds of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it is unclear how effective that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans may cover benefits differently.
