<p>Medicare is a national medical insurance program that covers millions of people and involves a fair larger number of healthcare suppliers and companies. If you've missed the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment interval, there's a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 every year.
