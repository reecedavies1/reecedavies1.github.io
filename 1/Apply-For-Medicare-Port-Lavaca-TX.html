<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent payments, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
