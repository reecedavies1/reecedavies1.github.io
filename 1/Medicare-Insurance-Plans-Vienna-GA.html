<p>Third, individuals who reside in two completely different geographical areas of the nation at different occasions of the year (principally so-called snowbirds) discover it tough to reside with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C risk adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to restrict this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how effective that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans could cover benefits in a different way.
