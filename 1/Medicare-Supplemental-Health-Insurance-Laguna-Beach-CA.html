<p>Just keep in mind that when you choose to wait to enroll in Part B, you’ll be charged a late enrollment penalty, and Part B coverage will cost you more. You should have both Part A and Part B to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medicare Supplement plan. You don't need to enroll in Part B right away, because you'll be charged a premium.
