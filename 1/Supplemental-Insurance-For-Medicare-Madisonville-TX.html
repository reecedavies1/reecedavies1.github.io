If you're required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you send in a denial letter from Social Security to maintain your current coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and a few have a corresponding companion plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your current retiree plan has a Medicare version or partner plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan whenever you turn sixty five, once Medicare has accredited your enrollment form.<p>
