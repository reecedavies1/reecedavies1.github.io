In most states and most circumstances, you’ll need to go through medical underwriting should you resolve to use for a Medigap plan after that window ends. During the five-star enrollment interval (December 8 – November 30), individuals who live in an area with a 5-star Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plan can swap to that plan in the event that they select to do so.<p>
<p>You can delay your Part B effective date as much as three months should you enroll while you still have employer-sponsored coverage or inside one month after that coverage ends.
