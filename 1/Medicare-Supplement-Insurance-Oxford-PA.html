The Medicare Advantage Disenrollment Period offers an MA plan enrollee the opportunity to disenroll from any MA plan and return to traditional Medicare between January 1 and February 14 of every year.<p>
<p>If you enroll in Medicare through the January – March General Enrollment period, you can enroll in Part D between April 1 and June 30. But Medicare Part B has a monthly premium — projected to be about $153.30/month in 2021 — which shall be deducted from your Social Security or Railroad Retirement check.

<p>But these averages mask broad regional and useful differences. Just as the most important advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the most important determinant of monthly premium differences is the size of that safety.

However, 18 p.c of beneficiaries in MA-PDs (2.8 million enrollees) pay a minimum of $50 per month, including 6 p.c who pay $one hundred or more per 30 days, in addition to the month-to-month Part B premium.<p>
