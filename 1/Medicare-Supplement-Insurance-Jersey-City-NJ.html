Any time in the course of the year, an individual enrolled in Original Medicare can apply for a different Medigap plan. But if it’s not in the course of the person’s one-time Medigap enrollment window, the insurer will doubtless use medical underwriting to determine whether to issue the policy and at what price.<p>
<p>Your benefits may not start until three months after applying, so it’s necessary to apply three months earlier than your 65th birthday to start out receiving coverage that day. The annual Medicare open enrollment interval does not apply to Medigap plans, that are solely guaranteed-issue in most states throughout a beneficiary’s preliminary enrollment interval, and during limited special enrollment intervals.
