You can't have a Medicare Supplement plan and a Medicare Advantage plan on the identical time. If you don't make any changes throughout AEP, your present plan will automatically renew the following year. The Special Enrollment Period lets you enroll in Original Medicare outside of your IEP due to sure life changes. For instance, you might wait to enroll when you're nonetheless working.<p>

<p>You can delay your Part B efficient date as much as three months if you enroll when you still have employer-sponsored coverage or inside one month after that coverage ends.

In distinction to Medicare Advantage plans, traditional Medicare doesn't typically require prior authorization for services, and doesn't require step remedy for Part B medication.<p>
