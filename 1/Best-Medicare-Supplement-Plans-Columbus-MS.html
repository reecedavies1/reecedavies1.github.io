<p>People who aren’t yet accumulating Social Security, or aren’t eligible for Social Security Retirement, aren’t mechanically enrolled into Medicare. Some folks get Medicare Part A and Part B routinely and some people want to sign up for them.<p>
<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans do not cover benefits like imaginative and prescient, dental, eyeglasses, listening to aids, or prescription drug coverage. If you need pharmaceuticals, you would need to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.
