Medicare MSA Plans combine a high deductible Medicare Advantage Plan and a belief or custodial savings account (as outlined and/or approved by the IRS).<p>
<p>Medicare Advantage plans cover all the original benefits you obtain beneath Original Medicare with the exception of hospice care. Medicare only pays for a certain variety of days within the hospital or in a talented nursing facility.Has an out-of-pocket maximum each year.
