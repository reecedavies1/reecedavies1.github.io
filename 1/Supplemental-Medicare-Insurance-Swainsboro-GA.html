When very small employers be part of along with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide primary coverage as long as no less than one of the employers has 20+ workers. But employers can also ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check together with his group plan to see what their particular rules are.
