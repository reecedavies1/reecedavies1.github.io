Medicare Advantage plans might prevent cash, but be sure to check whether or not prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll need to buy a separate Part D plan if you would like that coverage. Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and whether or not there are any limits in their coverage.
