Would you like to study extra about your Medicare benefits and coverage options, and the way a spouse’s eligibility would possibly affect your eligibility?<p>
<p>You also can enroll in a Part D plan should you solely enroll in Medicare Part B through the GEP. If you enroll in each Part A and Part B, you might choose to use for a Medicare Advantage , Medicare Prescription Drug , or Medicare Supplement plan.

By law, a Part C beneficiary can not spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical services; it's plans with this limit that have the lowest premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 yearly but in fact -- for these plans -- the premium is larger. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is often reported.<p>

In most cases, it depends on whether you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>
