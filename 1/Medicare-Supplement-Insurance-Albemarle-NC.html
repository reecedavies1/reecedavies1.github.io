<p>Yes, you possibly can enroll in Medicare at sixty five and cease paying premiums in your current insurance. The six months of retroactive coverage applies if you sign up for Medicare after age sixty five. At that point, if you enroll, your coverage dates again to both six months, or your 65th birthday — whichever is shorter. It doesn’t matter if your employer has 20 full-time or part-time employees; the edge is 20 to be considered a group health plan for Medicare particular enrollment purposes.<p>

Advantage plans are provided by private insurance companies and are required to cover every little thing you'd have with Original Medicare.<p>
