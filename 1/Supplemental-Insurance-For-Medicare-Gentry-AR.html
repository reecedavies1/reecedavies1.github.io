<p>Third, individuals who reside in two totally different geographical areas of the nation at totally different occasions of the 12 months (principally so-called snowbirds) discover it difficult to live with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C risk adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to restrict this churn between forms of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it is unclear how effective that equalization program is.
