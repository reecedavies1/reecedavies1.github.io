If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
