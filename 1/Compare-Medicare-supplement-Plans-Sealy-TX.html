<p>As a retiree this occurs if you turn sixty five; as a UC worker this occurs when you retire and you're sixty five or older. Medicare Part A is usually premium-free, however there's a monthly premium for Part B coverage, paid to the Social Security Administration.<p>
<p>By contrast, most Medicare Advantage plans negotiate cost rates and form networks with healthcare providers, just like how purely private medical health insurance plans operate.

Medicare Advantage enrollees are responsible for paying the Part B premium, in addition to any premium charged by the plan.<p>
