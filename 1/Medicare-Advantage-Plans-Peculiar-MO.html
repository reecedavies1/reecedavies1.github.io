<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
