<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
